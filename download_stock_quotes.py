"""
Script to download prices of different companies' stock
used to calculate the value of shares in an offer.
Ran during make by downloading a csv of Stock Prices from Yahoo.Finance
for most popular tech companies (list below).
Ran from makefile, so it prints to stdout, rather than logs.

If the OPTION_FLAGS determines the format of the csv, which is later read by a function in C.

TODO: add tests to assert that all relevant information is always present. If you change the flags - need to rerun the tests.

Running:

the script is run without args during installation and at any other time,
when you a new file needs to be created

python download_stock_quotes.py

When a stock_quote is missing from the file, run the script
with sys.argv[2] = stock_quote

python download_stock_quotes.py $STOCK_QUOTE
